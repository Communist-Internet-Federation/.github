# ☭ The Communist Internet Federation ☭

Our objective is to make the Internet a decentralized and surveilance free place for everyone out there. 

Let's speak out for everybody out there who gets opressed. Otherwise it will be you one day. 

Sadly nothing in the world is free... non the less we try to make everything free for you, so we're glad for every single [Donation](bitcoin:BC1QKE75ELVW5ZHG74GGP370A3SHALLR0LWPTUTY6J?label=Donations) we can get.
